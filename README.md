# Description
This is a simple image classification project created for Udacity's nanodegree program. It aims to accurately predict which of 102 different flower species an image is picturing. Data comes from the Oxford102 dataset.

# Main Project
The main project is found within the 'Project_Image_Classifier.ipynb' Jupyter Notebooks file. It trains a deep learning network and uses it to predict on new flower images.

# Predict.py
The 'predict.py' file takes an image, a model, and a label_map as input and returns what label the model gives the image. Use the file's '--help' functionality for more info.
